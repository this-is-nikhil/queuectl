# QueueCTL — Background Job Queue System (Node.js CLI)

##  Overview

**QueueCTL** is a CLI-based background job queue system built with Node.js.  
It allows you to enqueue shell commands as jobs, process them using worker processes, handle retries with exponential backoff, and maintain a **Dead Letter Queue (DLQ)** for failed jobs.

This project is made as part of the **QueueCTL Backend Developer Internship Assignment**.

## Features

CLI-based job management  
 Persistent job storage using JSON files  
Background workers to process jobs  
Retry mechanism with **exponential backoff**  
Dead Letter Queue (DLQ) for permanently failed jobs  
Simple commands to check job status and view the queue

---

## Tech Stack

**Node.js**
**Yargs** (for CLI)
**Child Process** (for executing shell commands)
**File System (fs)** for job persistence

##  Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/queuectl.git
   cd queuectl
   Install dependencies:
   npm install
   Make sure your Node version is v18 or higher (recommended v22+).
    Usage
   Run all commands from the project root.
    Enqueue a job
   node src/cli.js enqueue "echo Hello QueueCTL"
    Start worker(s)
   node src/cli.js start-workers 1
    List all jobs
   node src/cli.js list
    Show queue status
   node src/cli.js status
    View Dead Letter Queue (DLQ)
   node src/cli.js dlq
    Retry a failed DLQ job
   node src/cli.js retry-dlq <jobId>
    Retry & Backoff Logic
   Each job retries up to 3 times before being moved to the DLQ.
   Retry intervals follow exponential backoff:
   1st retry → 2s
   2nd retry → 4s
   3rd retry → 8s
    Dead Letter Queue (DLQ)
   Jobs that fail after all retry attempts are sent to the DLQ.
   You can view them using:
   node src/cli.js dlq
   And retry them manually using:
   node src/cli.js retry-dlq <jobId>
   ```

 Example Workflow
node src/cli.js enqueue "echo Processing file..."
node src/cli.js enqueue "ls -la"
node src/cli.js start-workers 2
node src/cli.js list
node src/cli.js status
